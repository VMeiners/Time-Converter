# Time-Converter

The Time Converter was created with C++. 

The client works with domestic and international clients and, as such, required a 12 hour and 24 hour clock for their website. Users can enter the minute, the hour, and the second to have their preferred time converted to either the 12 hour format or the 24 hour format.
